# Mann vs. Mann

**A custom Team Fortress 2 gamemode that puts Mann vs. Machine upgrades into regular gameplay.**

Mann vs. Mann was originally created by [Screwdriver](https://github.com/ScrewdriverHyena)
and [Kenzzer](https://github.com/Kenzzer) in 2018 for the Red Sun Over Paradise community. It was ultimately abandoned and never
publicly released due to countless issues.

To give the original developer's closure I decided to rewrite it from the ground up with many fixes and additional gameplay
elements.

## Features

- Working Mann vs. Machine mechanics in regular gameplay
    - Upgrades
    - Power up canteens
    - Money pickups
    - Buybacks
    - Revive markers
    - ...and much more
- Compatible with any map that has a resupply cabinet
- Configurable using plugin convars
