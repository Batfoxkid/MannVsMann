# Mann vs. Mann

## Regular Team Fortress 2 gameplay with Mann vs. Machine mechanics

Mann vs. Mann was originally created by [Screwdriver](https://github.com/ScrewdriverHyena)
and [Kenzzer](https://github.com/Kenzzer) for the Red Sun Over Paradise community.

The project was ultimately abandoned in 2018 due to countless issues. To give the project closure, I decided to rewrite it from
the ground up, with many fixes and additional gameplay elements.
